  You can now find CACTOS included on the Cloudiator platform. Cloudiator is a cross-cloud orchestration tool, allowing you to describe an application once and deploy it on virtual machines at different cloud providers.

Cloudiator also supports multiple cloud providers, meaning that an application can easily be deployed using multiple cloud provider‘s platforms. This supports the user in avoiding vendor lock-in. It can deploy the component instances of one application across multiple cloud platforms, making it possible to select the best offer on component basis and increasing availability.

Cloudiator’s monitoring system, allows the collection of system and application metrics by sensors as well as an easy to use push interface. The platform also features an aggregation and adaptation workflow, allowing the user to aggregate metrics and react on deviations using a simple, yet powerful scalability rule language.

Cloudiator has built-in docker support, allowing usage of docker images and isolating components running on the same virtual machine.

Also on Cloudiator, you can find CloudSocket. CloudSocket offers business and IT-Cloud alignment. The project investigates the concept of Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) by creating environments for the different stages, i.e. from the modelling of business processes up to their execution as a service in the Cloud. Alongside these two projects is the PaaSage project. PaaSage is a Model-based Cross-Cloud Development and Deployment Platform. The project provides an open source integrated platform to support design, model-based development, configuration, optimization and deployment of existing and new Cloud applications independently of the existing underlying Cloud infrastructures.
