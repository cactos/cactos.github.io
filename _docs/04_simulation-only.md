# Data Centre Scenario Specification and Modification

CactoSim provides a wealth of options to modify and adapt physical or logical data centre resources. This section of the user manual explains the individual building blocks used to define and manipulate various simulation scenarios in CactoSim. Users can combine those building blocks to fit the purpose of a specific data centre analysis. 

Each subsection contains detailed step-by-step instructions supported by screenshots of the actual graphical user interface provided by CactoSim. The aim is to cover the functionality of core features of this CactoSim release as well as to introduce the general principle notion of cloud modelling using the provided tree editor interface. This section presents the building blocks in a typical usage order, from importing the models from the Runtime Model Storage to versioning of a model for later analyses.
