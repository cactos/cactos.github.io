Once all of the model components have been created and configured (as shown in __Data Centre Scenario Specification and Modification__), the simulation experiment run has finished (as shown in __Run a Simulation__). This section explains how to access and read the experiment results post completion of a simulation run.

# Show resource utilisation for compute node

The Simulation results can be accessed, viewed and exported upon completion of a simulation run. From the Eclipse top menu, __Window -> Open Perspective -> Other -> PCM Results__ must be selected. The data store will be represented in the experiments tree view on the left hand side (*Figure 1*) arranged according to the execution time stamp and the name given in the previous step of simulation parameters setup.

*Figure 1: Show Resource Utilization for Compute Node*

Double-clicking on the resource tuple will bring up the option menu, as shown in Figure 27. Here the visualisation type for displaying simulated results can be selected.

*Figure 2: Visualisation selection*

Right-clicking will allow the user to access a chart export menu which allows for the moving of results for analysis elsewhere, as shown in Figure 3.

To view CPU utilisation results, select the entry named __State of Active Resource Tuple of CPU [x] on Node x__.

> Note that if the resource tuple has word “EMPTY” in front of it, it means that no data was collected during the simulation.
