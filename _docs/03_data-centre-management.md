A datacentre operator can *plug* CACTOS to enact performance optimisations in his datacentre. It is as easy as plug a new device to the power.
In CACTOS we have developed a toolkit that was developed mainly upon OpenStack. But, also can be enacted using other cloud middleware tools.

Moving to the architecture, the **OpenStack VMI** and **OpenStack VMI Controller** enable CACTOS functionality for OpenStack-based Cloud Installations (cf. Figure 1). 
 VMI enhances the default OpenStack REST interface to users so that they can also trigger application deployment. In addition, it intercepts 
 calls to the standard OpenStack interface dealing with spawning and terminating virtual machines. The VMI Controller in turn executes tasks 
 defined by CACTOS (mainly **CactoOpt**) on the data centre to enact optimisation decisions. The main component, which handles flows between CACTOS 
 and an OpenStack Cloud Platform, is the **Runtime Management**.

 In detail, incoming REST requests to VMI are translated from OpenStack format to a generic CACTOS format and then passed to the Runtime Management. 
 CactoOpt as well as the Runtime Management component use the VMI Controller to execute CACTOS generic tasks in an OpenStack specific way. The VMI 
 controller may issue requests to the OpenStack REST API, or to one of the two proxy services for controlling physical resources and power state of 
 compute nodes in the OpenStack data centre. For application instance deployment, CACTOS uses **[Cloudiator](https://cloudiator.github.io/)**, a multi-cloud application orchestration software. 
 The VMI and the VMI Controller communicate with Cloudiatorâ€™s Colosseum service to handle actions on application level.
