CACTOS targets a data centre operator to address challenges in efficient operation of heterogeneous cloud infrastructures. The solution approach is based on a continuous analytics process of monitoring data, 
optimization algorithms targeting automatic selection and implementation of elasticity and scalability rules.

# Installing CACTOS

The installation of CACTOS has been done using Puppet, for more efficient provisioning of the software.
Navigating through the usage scenarios of CACTOS, one can install individual components for just monitoring a datacentre and/or managing it.

Follow the guides to install [CactoScale](https://cactos.github.io/docs/installation-guides/installation-of-cactoscale/), [CactoOpt](https://cactos.github.io/docs/installation-guides/installation-of-cactoopt-and-integration-tools/) and [CactoSim](https://cactos.github.io/docs/installation-guides/installation-of-cactosim/) .

**Note:** The current installation of CACTOS was tested using **Openstack Kilo (API v2)** with **KVM** as hypervisor of the physical nodes.
